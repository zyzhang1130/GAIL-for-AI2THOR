# GAIL-for-AI2THOR
  This repository contains the source code of my project on implementing GAIL for AI2THOR environment.<br/><br />
cups_rl_data_collection(manual) is modified from cups-rl (https://github.com/TheMTank/cups-rl) to collect input to GAIL (metadata from AI2THOR). To use it, modify line 147 to 152 of GAIL-for-AI2THOR/cups_rl_data_collection(manual)/main.py to the data of interest generated by ActioNet. Refer to https://github.com/SamsonYuBaiJian/actionet for more detials on data generation.<br/><br />
stable-baselines is modified from Stable Baselines (https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/) with newly defined env for AI2THOR in run_in_AI2THOR_env.py. Run run_in_AI2THOR_env.py to start training. Currently this env supports 21 actions for the agent in AI2THOR envirnment. Feel free to add more if needed. Please refer to https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/gail.html for more details on how to run and refine tune GAIL and https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html for installation of stable-baselines.
