# GAIL-for-AI2THOR
  This repository contains the source code of my project on implementing GAIL for AI2THOR environment.
cups_rl_data_collection(manual) is modified from cups-rl (https://github.com/TheMTank/cups-rl) to collect input to GAIL (metadata from AI2THOR).
stable-baselines is modified from Stable Baselines (https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/) with newly defined env for AI2THOR in run_in_AI2THOR_env.py.
